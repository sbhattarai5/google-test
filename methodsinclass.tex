\section{Testing methods in a class}

This section will talk about how to test methods in a class. \\
\subsection{Create a class}
Let's create a simple class called \verb!Person!.
Paste the following code into a new \emph{test.cpp} file:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
#include <gtest/gtest.h> // including the library

// everything is made public to make this easy

class Person
{
public:
    Person()
      : age_(0)
    {}
    void add_age(int x)
    {
        age_ += x;
    }
    int age_;
};

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv); // initializing it
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS(); // this will run all your tests
}
  
\end{Verbatim}

Now let's test the methods of this class. You must have guessed that testing
this would require us to create an object and call it's methods.

\subsection{Testing constructors}
For instance, the following would be one of the ways to test the constructor:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
TEST(PersonTest, InitializationTest)
{
    Person p;
    EXPECT_EQ(p.age_, 0);
}
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Testing other methods}
For instance, the following would be one of the ways to test other methods:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
TEST(PersonTest, AddAgeTest)
{
    Person p;
    p.add_age(10);
    EXPECT_EQ(p.age_, 10);
}
\end{Verbatim}

This will be it for testing methods in the class. Testing a customized object
can be simplified further using \emph{Test Fixture} which is discussed in the
next section.
