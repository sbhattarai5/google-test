\section{Installation and Prerequisites}
As root do
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
dnf -y install gtest-devel
\end{Verbatim}

You can test your installation by doing
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
find /usr/include -name "gtest.h" -type f
\end{Verbatim}
If you see some results, you're good to go. \\ \\
For this tutorial, I'll assume that you know C++ and you're familiar with
classes and objects as well as pointers, however, first few sections won't
require understanding of classes, objects and pointers -- knowledge of functions
will suffice.
