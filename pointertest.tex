\section{Testing Pointers}

Testing pointers is exactly similar to the previous syntax. Let's see an
example.

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
void allocate(int *p)
{
    p = new int;
}
\end{Verbatim}

We have created an \verb!allocate! function, which allocates memory to
pointer \verb!p! from the heap and now we want to test it if the memory was
assigned. \\

The following will do the job:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
TEST(AllocateTest, NullPtrReplacement)
{
    int *p = nullptr;
    allocate(p);
    EXPECT_NE(p, nullptr);
}
\end{Verbatim}

\textit{Note: } While doing pointer comparisions, GoogleTest prefers
\verb!nullptr! over \verb!NULL!. Read
